- Biometric authentication required

#### RemoteWipeConfigViewController
- Configuration for remote wipe feature
- PIN code setup
- Enable/disable remote wipe functionality

#### Settings Integration
- Added emergency data wipe button in Settings
- Styled with destructive red theme
- Seamlessly integrated with existing settings

### 4. Constants and Configuration
- Added new constants for remote wipe
