# Fake Password UI Switching Feature

## Overview
The LockWhisper password manager now includes a seamless UI switching capability between real and fake (decoy) data. This feature enhances security by allowing users to display decoy passwords when under duress.

## Feature Highlights

### 1. Mode Indicator
- **Secure Mode**: ðŸ”’ Green indicator shows you're viewing real passwords
- **Decoy Mode**: ðŸ”“ Orange indicator shows you're viewing fake passwords

### 2. Quick Toggle
- Toggle button (â‡„) in the navigation bar allows instant switching
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental mode switches
- Smooth cross-fade animation during transition

### 3. Visual Differentiation
- Subtle orange tint to table background in decoy mode
- Orange navigation bar tint in decoy mode
- Orange delete swipe actions in decoy mode

### 4. Decoy Data Management
- Refresh button (â†») in decoy mode to regenerate fake passwords
- Realistic-looking decoy entries from various categories:
  - Banking & Finance
  - Social Media
  - Shopping
  - Email & Communication
  - Entertainment
  - Work & Productivity

### 5. Feedback System
- Success banners confirm mode switches
- "âœ“ Switched to Decoy Mode" or "âœ“ Switched to Secure Mode"
- "âœ“ Decoy passwords refreshed" when regenerating fake data

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial State**: User opens password manager in secure mode
2. **Switching Modes**: Tap toggle button â†’ Confirm switch â†’ Animated transition
3. **Visual Feedback**: Mode indicator updates, UI colors change, success banner appears
4. **Data Display**: Appropriate password list loads based on current mode
5. **Actions**: Add, edit, delete operations work seamlessly in both modes

## Security Benefits

- **Plausible Deniability**: Show convincing fake passwords when forced
- **Quick Access**: Instant switching without complicated processes
- **Visual Clarity**: Always know which mode you're in
- **Data Separation**: Real and fake data stored separately with different encryption

## Implementation Details

### Code Architecture
- `FakePasswordManager`: Handles mode switching and data routing
- `DecoyPasswordManager`: Generates and manages fake password data
- `PasswordViewController`: UI implementation with mode awareness
- Separate encryption managers for real and fake data

### Key Files Modified
- `/Password/PasswordViewController.swift`: Added UI switching logic
- `/Other/FakePasswordManager.swift`: Enhanced with public mode property
- `/Password/DecoyPasswordManager.swift`: Already implemented decoy data generation

### UI Components
- Mode indicator label with dynamic text/color
- Toggle button with arrow icon
- Refresh button for decoy data
- Success banner notifications
- Subtle background tinting

## Testing the Feature

1. Enable fake password in settings
2. Open Password module
3. Toggle between modes using the â‡„ button
4. Observe UI changes and data switching
5. Try refresh button in decoy mode
6. Test CRUD operations in both modes

## Notes

- Feature only appears when fake password system is enabled
- All operations (add/edit/delete) work independently in each mode
- Data persistence is maintained separately for each mode
- Encryption keys are different for real and fake data
